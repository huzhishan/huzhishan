# ðŸ’« About Me :
I got my Ph.D. degree at University of Macau. Currently, Iâ€™m working at Shanghai Mental Health Center as an assistant research fellow. Before that, i worked at Beijing Normal University as a postdoctoral research fellow. My research is focused on the use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in neuroscience investigation. These investigations include fNIRS signal processing, cognitive mechanism underlying psychiatric disorders and aging, and the role of cortical activity in cognitive processing.
